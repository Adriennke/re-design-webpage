            <h2>CELEBRATING YALE SCHOOL OF ART’S 150TH YEAR</h2>
            <p>
                The start of the 2019-2020 academic year marks the 150th anniversary of the Yale School of Art, which
                opened for its first day of classes on October 15, 1869. To commemorate this sesquitennial, the Yale
                School of Art commissioned Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Caroline M. Street Professor of Graphic
                Design, Director of Graduate Studies in Graphic Design, and a 1964 alumnus of the Graphic Design
                program, and Laura Coombs, 2017 Graphic Design alumnus and Senior Designer at the New Museum of
                Contemporary Art in New York, to create an anniversary mark that both celebrates and conveys the
                profound history of the School.
