    <h1>YALE SCHOOL OF ART</h1>

            <h2>About the school</h2>
            <p>
                Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided an educational context in
                which they can
                explore the potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical dialogue. This dialogue
                is generated by
                their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by a faculty comprised of professional artists of
                acknowledged
                accomplishment.

                The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own studio
                activity.
                Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous, structured
                courses such as
                drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich academic offerings found throughout Yale.
                Each student is
                routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty members and visitors. The
                School is
                devoted not only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to the cultivation of the mind. Students
                must bring
                creative force and imagination to their own development, for these qualities cannot be taught—they can
                only be
                stimulated and appreciated.

                The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale College (see the bulletin Yale
                College Programs
                of Study). In addition, the School’s courses are open to students in the Graduate School of Arts and
                Sciences and other
                professional schools of the University, and School of Art students may enroll in elective courses in the
                Graduate School
                and other professional schools as well as in the College with permission.

            <h2>CELEBRATING YALE SCHOOL OF ART’S 150TH YEAR</h2>
            <p>
                The start of the 2019-2020 academic year marks the 150th anniversary of the Yale School of Art, which
                opened for its first day of classes on October 15, 1869. To commemorate this sesquitennial, the Yale
                School of Art commissioned Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Caroline M. Street Professor of Graphic
                Design, Director of Graduate Studies in Graphic Design, and a 1964 alumnus of the Graphic Design
                program, and Laura Coombs, 2017 Graphic Design alumnus and Senior Designer at the New Museum of
                Contemporary Art in New York, to create an anniversary mark that both celebrates and conveys the
                profound history of the School.

            <p>

                practice contributes to the evolving conversation around post-blackness, sexuality and power. She is a
                fierce mentor who has supported emerging queer black artists, through fostering critical conversations
                and assisting with professional development.”
